        <p> In Spring 2015, I built a SaaS Project Management Web Application in Django. It is meant to be used by Project Managers and Developers using Agile Scrum development methodologies. I also worked on a team to develop a mobile application for a local non-profit organization in Pittsburgh. The mobile application was built on PhoneGap, using HTML/CSS/JavaScript.      
        <br><br>
        In Spring 2013, I developed a Stock Portfolio Management System in Python 2.7 that web-scraped pages for stock information. It constantly refreshed local portfolio data, calculated portfolio returns and managed cash flow.
